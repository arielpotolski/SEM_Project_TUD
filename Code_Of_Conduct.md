# Code of Conduct

    1. Meet at least once weekly (after TA meeting). In these meetings, we will focus on discussing and deciding on the next sprint, as well as discussing topics that require input from all the members of the group.

    2. Sprints start on Thursdays, after the meeting, and end on Tuesday evenings. Try, however, to always finish the sprint by Monday evenings, so we can have Tuesdays to review and make changes to the code. We are expected to have everything from that week's sprint merged into the main branch by Wednesday mornings.

    3. We are going to work in either pairs, and each of them will be responsible for one microservice. That way, we can parallelize the work. However, be sure you know what is being implemented by the other microservices, and how they work.

    4. At least two people should review each merge request, one from each of the other two pairs.

    5. Always read the commits and merges made on each week before the TA meeting, so you have a grasp of everything that is going on. Make sure you are prepared to answer any questions during the meeting, about any of the microservices. Make sure you know what is happening in each part of the code, and have an overall view of how the system works.

    6. No merge request should drop the test coverage below 75%.

    7. Use gitlab features such as labels, milestones, weights and assignments.

    8. Write javadoc for every method.

    9. Kasper will be the chairman on the TA meetings.

    10. In case of disagreement on how to tackle a problem, both people should present their arguments, after which a voting will take place to decide which approach we will follow.
