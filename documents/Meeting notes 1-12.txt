Notes meeting 1-12

Should start coding ASAP

Microservice Design
- Request information is spread out => not microservice
- so all requests should be stored and kept on request service (not user service)


- who made request => stored in userservice
- request entity is a class that should not be autheticated (do that in user service)
- same for cluster service

- sysadmin acces not needed in cluster service. But it works there so let's keep it that way

- User service will be the most work in the beginning

We decided we will work in duos
- User Service (Kasper & Bart)
- Request Service (Alexander & Vladimir)
- Cluster Service (Ariel & Alan)

Naming comvention: delft blue => db
DO MOSCOW ASAP
week 5 midterm => lab non mandatory. We should decide 1 week before if we want to meet

Do a sprint retrospective
all submissions on gitlab in the folder/merge to main

Look into delft blue documenation for inspiration.
What kind of database will we use. In memory probably.
